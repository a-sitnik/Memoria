Simple Android notes

## History
At first, it was very simple, using only standard android tools. But it was finished, usable and reliable product.
Then I researched of making some swipe and decided to use external library, swipelistview by 47deg seemed good enough.  
After most of work was done, its author simply deleted it, I realized it is not very perspective to continue using this lib.  

Then tried to reconstruct it using baoyongzhang SwipeMenuListView, but it fits badly for my task and became also deprecated. 

In spite of loosing interest in further development, here it stands, unfinished but functional, still in my personal usage

Simple Android notes

## History
At first, it was very simple, using only standart android tools. But it was finished usable and reliable product.
Then I researched of making some swipe and decided to use external library, swipelistview by 47deg seemd good enough.  
After much efforts of adding swipe by this badly documented lib, its author simply deleted it. It was lost after syncro and I fixed it in ugly way from sample project files, but seems its not very perspective to continue using this lib.  

Then tried to reconstruct it using https://github.com/baoyongzhang/SwipeMenuListView, but it fits badly for my task and became also deprecated. 

In spite of loosing interest in further development, here it stands, unfinished but functional, still in my personal usage
